<h1>Sonification Resources</h1>
<p>
I'm rather new to sonification's mysteries, pleasures, uses, and
frustrations, but it's been around for awhile, with people exploring
all sorts of aspects and applications for it. Here's a few other
researchers and sonifiers that have inspired me and whose work helped
me along the way so far:
<p>
<a href=http://sonification.de>Thomas Herrman</a> provides a
good introduction to the field, and some of his work sonifying motion.
<p>
Georgia Tech has a interdisciplinary
<a href=http://sonify.psych.gatech.edu/>Sonification Lab</a> where
they research sonification with an emphasis on using it to help people with vision disabilities navigate, learn math, and even explore and experience an aquarium.
<p>
<a href=http://www.lhcsound.com>LHCsound</a> is a group of physicists who are exploring Large Hadron Collider data via sound.
<p>
John Flowers of the University of Nebraska has a <a href=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1429&context=psychfacpub>nice summary</a> of some of the potential and pitfalls of using sonification to explore datasets.
