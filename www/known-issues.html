<h3>Known Issues with playitbyr</h3>

Currently the biggest issue outstanding with <code>playitbyr</code> is
getting the audio to play in Linux correctly. The <code>audio</code>
package, which provides the interface to a computer's audio
functionality, doesn't appear to work very well for its portaudio
implementation, at least on my Ubuntu and Xubuntu computers. I'm working on a workaround that I'll post here shortly.
