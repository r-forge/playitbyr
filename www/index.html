<h3> playitbyr: Data Through Sound</h3>

<p> What's your data saying? <code>playitbyr</code> allows you to
  listen to a data.frame in R by mapping columns onto sonic
  parameters, creating an auditory graph. Many clever people have
  developed tools and interfaces for sonification, but there's just
  not that much out there to sonify straight from a statistics package
  like R.

<p>
  To make sonification easier to learn, the package mimics the syntax
  of the popular and beautiful <code>ggplot2</code>
  package. <code>sonify</code> objects, created by
  the <code>sonify()</code> function, contain both the data to be
  sonified and the mappings and scalings of the sound
  parameters. Users can tweak their sonificaiton by adding other
  mappings, scalings, and data to the mix. The current development
  version of the package can be installed in R with the command:
<p>
<code>install.packages("playitbyr", repos="http://www.r-project.org")</code>

<p>
 A CRAN release will be coming in summer 2011; there are still several
outstanding issues, including getting the sound players to work more gracefully
 . <code>playitbyr</code> depends on the audio package for playing and
 saving sounds.
