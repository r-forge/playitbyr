<p> What's your data saying? <code>playitbyr</code> allows you to
  listen to a data.frame in R by mapping columns onto sonic
  parameters, creating an auditory graph. Many clever people have
  developed tools and interfaces for sonification, but there's just
  not that much out there to sonify straight from a statistics package
  like R. (There has been some considerable work done
  for <a href="http://www.sonification.com.au/sonipy/">Python</a>.)
<p>
  To make sonification easier to learn, the package mimics the syntax
  of the popular and beautiful <code>ggplot2</code>
  package. <code>sonify</code> objects, created by
  the <code>sonify()</code> function, contain both the data to be
  sonified and the mappings and scalings of the sound
  parameters. Users can tweak their sonificaiton by adding other
  mappings, scalings, and data to the mix. 
<p>
  Sonification helps us detect things in data that we would not catch
  visually and provides a useful new way of interfacing with
  data. <a href=http://sonification.de>Thomas Herrman</a> provides a
  good introduction to the field and its applications.
<p>
  Just as visualization can help us to look at the world and see in
  new ways, sonification, opens our ears to new varieties of
  beautiful, annoying, horrifying, and delightful sounds. My blind
  wanderings in this vast sonic world are charted on my anything-goes blog,

  Sounds of Data and Whimsy</a>

<p>
  I plan to release a bare-bones alpha version in July 2011, and begin
  expanding from there. My enthusiasm for sonification is rabid but my
  experience is minimal, so I'm eager for feedback from users as well
  as the clever witches and brow-furrowed wizards of the sonification
  world
<p>  
  There are still several major outstanding issues, including getting
  the sound players to work more gracefully and improving interfaces
  to MIDI and csound. <code>playitbyr</code> depends on the audio
  package for playing and saving sounds generated natively from R; for
  MIDI, it currently depends on the csvmidi utility; and for more
  advanced sound synthesis it depends on csound and csound's Tcl
  interface.
<p>
  With cleverness and only a little telepathy, you could probably
  get <code>playitbyr</code> working on your computer, especially if
  it's Linux-based. See the
  <a href=https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/playitbyr/>R-forge
  project site</a>, which is set up rather like Sourceforge, for how
  to download the source code and related info.
