<p><br>
  <code>playitbyr</code> provides a high-level interface from the R
  command line to map data and statistical summaries to sonic
  parameters, with its syntax modeled after the popular graphics
  add-on package <code>ggplot2</code>. The basic package provides
  audio renderings done in R via the <code>audio</code> package.
